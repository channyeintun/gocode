# Progress

## 2026-04-10

- Implemented Phase 2 of `plan.md` against upstream sourcecode references by rendering tool-use entries inline in the transcript instead of in a separate floating widget.
- Added transcript ordering state in `useEvents` so user messages, tool calls, and assistant messages render in event order during a turn.
- Reworked `ToolProgress.tsx` into a sourcecode-style tool row with status dots and indented response content for running, permission-waiting, completed, and failed states.
- Implemented Phase 1 of `plan.md` for tool-use parity: replaced the TUI's transient single-tool state with persistent tool-call state keyed by tool id.
- Added explicit frontend payload typing for `tool_progress`, `tool_result`, and `tool_error`, and enriched Go-side tool result/error payloads so tool rows can survive failures before execution completes.
- Updated engine permission events to include `tool_id` and moved `tool_start` earlier in execution so permission waits and denials attach to the correct tool-use entry.
- Created `plan.md` first for sourcecode-aligned tool-use parity work, with phased implementation steps and explicit upstream references.
- Referenced upstream sourcecode input behavior before implementation, primarily `sourcecode/hooks/useArrowKeyHistory.tsx` and `sourcecode/components/PromptInput/PromptInputFooter.tsx`.
- Ported a sourcecode-inspired TUI input improvement into `go-cli/tui`: prompt history on Up/Down, persistent draft restore, placeholder text, and a footer hint row for primary shortcuts.
- Kept history state in the app layer via `usePromptHistory` so it survives temporary input unmounts such as permission prompts.
- Validated the TypeScript TUI build after the change.

**Current state:** All four provider clients, the Bash tool, and the file read/write/edit/glob/grep/web_search/web_fetch/git tools are implemented, along with the streaming executor needed to overlap safe tool calls. The default CLI path now launches the Ink frontend as the parent process and runs the Go engine as a stdio child over NDJSON, with status, artifact, compaction, permission/error states, preserved conversation history, and live assistant/tool activity rendered in the TUI while the engine remains recoverable if the configured model is unavailable at startup. The stdio engine persists and restores transcript + session metadata, generates session titles via local model after the first query, supports runtime `/model` switching, exposes `/plan`, `/fast`, `/compact`, `/model`, `/cost`, `/usage`, `/resume`, `/clear`, `/help`, `/status`, `/sessions`, and `/diff` over the stdio command path, emits markdown-backed implementation-plan/tool-log artifacts during planning and oversized tool execution, keeps plan mode read-only through planner enforcement, loads CLAUDE.md/CLAUDE.local.md/.claude/rules/\*.md project instruction files into the system prompt, tracks file edit history for undo/rewind with content-addressed backups, fires pre/post-tool and session lifecycle hooks from ~/.config/go-cli/hooks/, and now shapes requests by model capability: native tool definitions are withheld for text-only models, `ultrathink` only enables extended thinking on supported models, context thresholds already track each model's window, and tool-output budgets scale with model output capacity.
